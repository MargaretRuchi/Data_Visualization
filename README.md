Data Visualization â€“ Titanic Dataset
This project showcases various visualizations on the Titanic dataset to extract patterns, compare feature impacts on survival, and strengthen exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Dataset: Titanic train.csv from Kaggle

Focus: Exploring visual trends related to survival using categorical and numerical features.

Tools Used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights
Below are saved PNG visualizations with brief descriptions:

 viz_survival_count.png â€” Countplot showing number of survivors vs non-survivors.

 viz_survival_by_sex.png â€” Survival rates by gender; females had higher chances of survival.

 viz_survival_by_class.png â€” Higher class passengers (Pclass=1) had better survival rates.

 viz_survival_by_embarked.png â€” Slight survival variation based on embarkation port.

 viz_age_kde_by_survival.png â€” KDE plots comparing age distribution between survivors and non-survivors.

 viz_fare_distribution_survival.png â€” Fare distribution with survival; higher fares correlated with survival.

 viz_fare_vs_age_scatter.png â€” Scatter plot of Age vs Fare, colored by survival.

 viz_correlation_heatmap.png â€” Heatmap of correlation between numerical features.

 viz_gender_distribution.png â€” Distribution of gender in the dataset.

 viz_survival_class_gender.png â€” Survival breakdown by both class and gender.

 viz_pairplot.png â€” Multi-feature pairwise comparison to reveal relationships.

All visualizations are saved in the project directory and can be used in reports or portfolio presentations.
